# Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays that works by jumping ahead by fixed steps and then performing a linear search within the identified block.
# Time Complexity: O(âˆšn) where n is the number of elements in the array.
# Space Complexity: O(1) since it uses a constant amount of space.
